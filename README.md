# NFC VU Meter Business Card
I made a NFC business card themed to look like one of my TEAC A3340S VU meters. When you tap the card with your phone, the PEAK indicator lights up, just as it would on a real VU meter! I made this project because I have been calibrating, collecting, and repairing audio equipment for many many years now. Naturally, most of the machines have VU meters on them, and I feel as though they have become the staple representation of my hobby. Additionally, I needed a business card for career fair coming up in Spring.
