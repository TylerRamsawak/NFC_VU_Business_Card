<h3>Preparing for Shipment</h3>
Through a bit of back and forth, I've gotten my project up to submission guidelines. Here are some things you need to do in order to get approval:
1. Show full cart screenshots (that shows what you're buying, shipping, and end price)
2. Clarify that you chose the cheapest shipping option possible
3. Make an HTML table of your BOM and make sure your BOM reflects the Digikey cart. (I don't think a screenshot counted)

<h3>Designed Schematic, VU meter silkscreen, and Laid out PCB
</h3>
I calibrate reel to reel machines as my main hobby and side hustle. By virtue, VU meters seemed like a cool business card idea. First, I mocked up the design for the silkscreen in illustrator. I based this design off my very own TEAC A3340S VU meters.

Then I used KiCAD's built in BMP to footprint editor to get the silkscreens.

Then, I found a tutorial (https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) that walked me through the the Application Schematic from the NT3H2111W0FHKH. I downloaded the footprint and symbol from Digikey and copied the schematic.

Next, I laid out the PCB which took the longest. I had some struggle choosing fonts and the built in font editor in KiCAD kinda sux, requiring a lot of trial and error. Eventually, I settled on this layout:

And here is what the render looks like:

Please be aware that wallets seem to be a little smaller than what the internet says is standard US business card size. My wallet only fits a credit card. So, using a caliper, I measured that the business card should be 84.5mm, not 88.9mm that the guide told me. I still used the same height for a standard US business card of 50.8mm. 
Width: 84.5mm (not 88.9mm)
Height: 50.8mm (same as guide)
