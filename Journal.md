I calibrate reel to reel machines as my main hobby and side hustle. By virtue, VU meters seemed like a cool business card idea. First, I mocked up the design for the silkscreen in illustrator. I based this design off my very own TEAC A3340S VU meters.

Then I used KiCAD's built in BMP to footprint editor to get the silkscreens.

Then, I found a tutorial (https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/hacker-card) that walked me through the the Application Schematic from the NT3H2111W0FHKH. I downloaded the footprint and symbol from Digikey and copied the schematic.

Next, I laid out the PCB which took the longest. I had some struggle choosing fonts and the built in font editor in KiCAD kinda sux, requiring a lot of trial and error. Eventually, I settled on this layout:

And here is what the render looks like:

Please be aware that wallets seem to be a little smaller than what the internet says is standard US business card size. My wallet only fits a credit card. So, using a caliper, I measured that the business card should be 84.5mm, not 88.9mm that the guide told me. I still used the same height for a standard US business card of 50.8mm. 
Width: 84.5mm (not 88.9mm)
Height: 50.8mm (same as guide)
